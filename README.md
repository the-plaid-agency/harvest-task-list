Everyone can use their best discretion where their task should fall. If ever an employee has any questions about where their time should fall into the tasks on a specific project, the individual can always confirm with the account owner of the project. As a reminder, individuals should bill to the role that they are filling on the project for meetings (i.e. designer would bill to graphic design; a developer to programming, etc.).
